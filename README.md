# Security Forcer
A composer package to force laravel developers' for composer security. 
This package should not be included in production or for finished applications.

### Use of this package in practice
* You can use this to test your anti-malware, anti-virus packages/scripts.
* You can use this to stop your working code in case if your client steals your code with an unpaid portion of your earnings.
* You should be able to set a timer which would cause troubled times after the given date for the project.
* If you are to use this project for a shady client to secure your unpaid earnings please remember to remove it from the composer dependencies once/if you ever get your payment.

This package would only cause trouble / broke a working site / give strange errors and cause a buggy application. It will never steal any information or damage database entries etc. It is intended to cause soft but much effective bugs.

You won't be able to cause any damage at all if conditions are not met. For example security-forcer will not target any project but a project you specifically told to target and (optionally) only after given date. More documentation and actions will be listed once the first release is ready.

Please don't use this package for an unlawful action. I don't have any responsibility for your use of this package.

You are welcome to fork it and change code for your needs.
